What's the Cmd Class?
The Cmd class in Python provides a simple framework for building line-oriented command interpreters. Here's a breakdown:

Purpose:

It's designed for creating command-line interpreters, which are handy for building tools, administrative utilities, or prototypes that might later get a fancier interface.
Class Definition:

class cmd.Cmd(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)
When you create an instance of Cmd, you're essentially setting up a framework for handling commands and providing an interactive interface.
Usage:

You typically don't directly use Cmd but instead subclass it. By doing this, you inherit the methods provided by Cmd and can define your own methods to handle specific commands.
Completion Key:

The completekey argument is optional and defaults to 'Tab'. If the readline library is available, it enables automatic command completion when the user hits the specified key.
Input and Output:

You can specify input and output file objects using the stdin and stdout arguments. If not provided, they default to sys.stdin and sys.stdout.
Raw Input:

If you want to use a specific stdin, ensure to set the instance's use_rawinput attribute to False. This prevents ignoring the specified stdin.
How to Use It:
Subclassing:

You create your own class that inherits from Cmd.
Define methods in your class for handling specific commands. These methods should follow a naming convention like do_commandname.
Command Loop:

Once your class is set up, you start the command loop using the cmdloop() method. This prompts the user for input and executes the appropriate method based on the entered command.
Here's a simple example:

import cmd

class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, arg):
        print("Hello,", arg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_cmd_instance = MyCmd()
    my_cmd_instance.cmdloop()
In this example, typing "hello World" would print "Hello, World."
